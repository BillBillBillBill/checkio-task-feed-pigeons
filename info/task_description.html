    When I start to feed my pigeon, a minute later two more fly by. And a minute later another 3.
    Then 4, and so on. One portion of food lasts a pigeon for a minute.
    In case there's not enough food for all the birds, the pigeons that came first, eat first.
    Pigeons are hungry animals and eat without stopping.
    If I have <strong>N</strong> portions of wheat, how many pigeons will be fed with at least one portion of wheat?

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is an example how we can make a model for various situations.
    Of course, the model has a limited approximation, but often we don't need a perfect model.
